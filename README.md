## Description

Project Overview

Hello! 👋 Welcome to the PCMS Developer Technical Test: Simple Material Request Application (frontend Setup).

## Project setup

```bash
$ Important Information, you must atleast using Node v22 and npm V10
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
$ npx next build && npx next start -p 4000
```

or 

```bash
$ npx next dev -p 4000
```

Why are we running the local server in port 4000? because backend already using port 3000, well default local server that next js run is 3000 too, so either change the backend port or frontend port, you can also use another port if you want to.

- the server will be running in http://localhost:4000
